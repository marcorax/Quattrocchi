# Quattrocchi
Quattrocchi (four eyes, or person that wears glasses in Italian) is a mixed model, event and frame based, to infer disparity from a couple of DAVIS Neuromorphic Cameras

The project is based on the assumption of cooperation between the Magno and Parvo visual pathways,
The Magno scripts are written in Python and simulate a spiking neural network meant to work,
real time on Dynap-se (or other neuromorphic devices), a neuromorphic processor developed at the Neuroinformatic institute of Zurich. The Parvo scripts are in Matlab and they are a concept of the cooperation of the two streams and they are also used for comparing the model with a traditional multiscale energy one.
A different Magno_Pathway implementation is in the work and it will be in Opencl, to leverage the 
possibility to build a small and energy efficient solution in the future, for stereo active vision.

The Magno_Pathway is supposed to be used on spyder, packet managing with anaconda is also advised.
The dependency are listed here:

Brian2 (The framework for SNN simulation)

Teili (A Library for dynap-se simulation based on Brian2)
(The repo is still private and it will be opened to the public soon)

and also numpy scipy pypng pyqtgraph pyopengl

The Data folders should house all the data needed for the models to work, and files generated by the scripts.

The Magno Path has the priority since it is computing the coarse disparity estimation.
The normal flow is to load the recordings in the Data folder, compute them through Monocular_neurons.py then Binocular_neurons.py, and extract the frames with AedatMovieMaker.py
In Magno_Pathway/Tools
The frames need to be converted in mat with Parvo_Pathway/Tools/FramesImporter.m
And then it will possible to run /Parvo_Pathway/Disparity_Surfaces.m to compute the Parvo Pathway activity with Disparity_Surfaces.m, the results can be confronted with the script Energy_Model_Pyramidal.m
